<p class="about2">
Ballroom Dance Club started in June 2016. Our history isn't like any of the super hero movie that goes from bottom to top. We have been the best since our foundation was organized. A group of people from the Lindisfarne, who had been dancing to the jukebox at the St. Peters club facility got together to organize the Lindisfarne Ballroom Dance Club. As soon as you step into the club, you will quickly learn this is not your typical dance club. Don’t be startled if you get a BIG HELLO from our staff.  We might even share a few jokes with you.  What can we say, we love to have fun and share our love of dance with everyone that enters our dancing club. OUR MISSION is to empower lives step by step. We are celebrating our first annual anniversary.
